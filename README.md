## üîç Implementation Details

### News Data
Currently, the app uses mock data provided in the `NewsService.ts` file. In a production environment, you would integrate with a real news API like NewsAPI.org by:

1. Obtaining an API key from the service
2. Replacing the mock data fetching with actual API calls
3. Adding the API key to your environment variables (not in source control)

### Error Handling
The app implements comprehensive error handling to ensure a smooth user experience:

- Network error states
- Empty state views
- Image loading fallbacks
- Data validation

### State Management
Application state is managed using React's Context API and hooks. Local component state is handled with useState, while more complex state logic uses useReducer.
